            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                From today's featured article <br>
                David Kelly (14 May 1944 – 17 July 2003) was a Welsh authority on biological warfare. <br>
                Appointed to the United Nations Special Commission in 1991 as a chief weapons inspector in Iraq, he led ten of the organisation's missions. <br>
                After the publication of a dossier in 2002, which stated that Iraq could deploy chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes, Kelly had an off-the-record interview with Andrew Gilligan of the BBC about the claim. <br>
                Gilligan's reporting stated that Alastair Campbell, the Downing Street director of communications, insisted on the 45-minute claim, something which Kelly denied saying. <br>
                Kelly appeared before a parliamentary committee on 15 July 2003, and before another the next day; he was found dead near his home the day after. <br>
                Tony Blair, the prime minister, set up an inquiry under Lord Hutton that concluded that Kelly had killed himself. 
                A review led by Dominic Grieve between 2010 and 2011 backed the finding. 
                Kelly's death has been the subject of documentaries and been fictionalised in media works.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

            <p>Thanks to Ryan Murphy and the incredible performance of Evan Peters, the crimes of Jeffrey Dahmer are once again in the limelight. <br>
                Netflix is continuing its trend of dropping a brand-new crime series with a companion documentary that gives further insight into the crimes, the investigations, and the real lives of those who impacted the case, and of those who were impacted. <br>
                It’s a Netflix debut for actress Mila Kunis and what better way to make a debut than in a thriller that is sure to have many people talking this weekend. <br>
                Ani FaNelli seems to have it all: a glamorous job at a glossy magazine, an enviable figure with the wardrobe to match, and a handsome fiancé from a distinguished blue-blood family. <br>
